UCLA's CA Epsilon Chapter was founded in 1952. Since then, it has since become an integral part of the UCLA's student organizations and the Engineering community. Tau Beta Pi organizes events on and off campus for mentorship, professional development, community service, and fun!\r\n\r\nSome of the most notable Tau Beta Pi events are the free drop in tutoring service and the Internship Insider Night. The free drop in tutoring service is held in Boelter Hall 6266, where upperclassmen volunteer their time to help with any lower division math and science courses. This service is open to all students on the UCLA campus. Please visit the tutoring page for the schedule of tutors and subjects at the end of Week 2. Another upcoming event is the Internship Insider Night, which will be held on October 8th (Tuesday of Week 3). A panel of upperclassmen will speak about their internship experiences, give you tips about the job hunt, and answer any questions you may have about the process. In addition to these events, Tau Beta Pi hosts a variety of competitions throughout the year to encourage creativity and teamwork, such as the Rube Goldberg Competition hosted in Winter Quarter. Details about the competition and how to sign up can be found on the chapter website.\r\n", "joining"=>"To be eligible for initiation into Tau Beta Pi, you must be in the top fifth of your senior class, or top eighth of the junior class (by units). However, the vast majority of our events and competitions are open to all students!"}, "commit"=>"Create New Club"}

The Rocket Project at UCLA, Design/Build/Fly (DBF), and Unmanned Air Vehicle (UAV) are all AIAA engineering projects active throughout the year. Each project is entirely student run, and welcomes passionate engineers who love to learn and grow with dedicated and ambitious teammates. AIAA also holds fun professional networking events! In the past, we've hosted successful events such as ATK Company Tour, Lockheed Martin Game night, MAE Alumni Networking Night, and numerous company information nights. We also have social events bringing students to the Miramar Air show, kayaking, BBQs, and trips to the California Science Center.
