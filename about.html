				<h3>What is a student organization?</h3>
				<p>
					One of the integral parts to life within UCLA and UCLA Engineering
					is participation in student groups/organizations. There are over 30
					student groups, and several hundred students help serve and lead these groups.
					Each student group has its own demographics and purposes. However, all
					of them combine to provide the best possible experience for every
					student here at UCLA.
				</p>
				<p>
					Student organizations present a unique opportunity for students because
					they are entirely student run with only advisory support from faculty.
					As a result, many of the activities hosted by student organizations are
					created from the standpoint of a student rather than the school. 
				</p>
				<p>
					They range in size and purpose: from a few individuals to several hundred,
					from community service engineering groups to honor societies. No matter your
					interest or personality, there is a student organization that would love to
					have you!

				<h3>Why join a student organization?</h3>
				<p>
					With a lot of coursework and plenty of other activities available on
					campus, participating in student organizations may appear to be the last
					thing on your mind. However, participating in student organizations 
					provide many benefits at the same time. They include:
				</p>
				<ul>
					<li>Diversified experience to put on your resume</li>
					<li>Creation of a network of talented individuals</li>
					<li>Opportunities to meet with companies</li>
					<li>Change to improve UCLA Engineering</li>
				</ul>
				<p>
					Throughout the entire nation, students are earning engineering degrees
					from several great universities. With their education, they are qualified
					to solve almost any technical issue thrown at them. As a result, many 
					companies are beginning to look at the non-technical skill sets of their
					candidates, which aren't usually taught in a classroom. That is where participation
					in student organizations can be highly beneficial. They provide the chance
					to develop skills such as public speaking, management, and teamwork that
					are just as necessary to succeed in the real world. Furthermore, companies
					understand the talent found in student organization leadership and go to them
					first for talent. So find one that fits your desires and try it out!
